    doctors involved, and initially, from a real-life clinical question. Our group is
    multidisciplinary,  which involves an  interplay between physics, materials science, synthetic
    organic chemistry, engineering, biology, and medicine. We aim that many of our
    designs could be clinically applicable in the future, and have a tremendous social impact
    in treating diseases.

    animal and cellular models with clinical proteomics, we aim to deepen our understanding
    of the biology behind these conditions.'
  projects:
  - 'We focus on Parkinson’s disease, using deep proteomic profiling of blood cells
    to detect pre-symptomatic changes. This includes developing new informatics to
    decode the “dark proteome” of cohorts like PPMI to identify early biomarkers.
    We also study depression cohorts to find markers predicting treatment response.
    Together, this work offers insight into immune cell roles in brain disorders.'
  techniques:
  - Our lab combines fluorescence imaging and proteomics methods with neurobiology,
    biochemistry, and data science to reach our goals.
  funding:
  - These projects are funded by the Michael J Fox Foundation, the Research Council
    of Finland, EU ERANET, Immudocs, and Inflames. We participate in international networks
