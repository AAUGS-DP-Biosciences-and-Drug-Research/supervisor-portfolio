  expertise:
  - 'Our lab investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying brain disorders, with
    specialized expertise in the signaling pathways regulated by the protein kinases
    JNK and LRRK2. We have uncovered novel insights into how these kinases influence
    anxiety-like behaviors and neuronal death in Parkinson’s disease. By integrating
    animal and cellular models with clinical proteomics, we aim to deepen our understanding
    of the biology behind these conditions.'
  projects:
  - 'We focus on Parkinson’s disease, using deep proteomic profiling of blood cells
    to detect pre-symptomatic changes. This includes developing new informatics to
    decode the “dark proteome” of cohorts like PPMI to identify early biomarkers.
    We also study depression cohorts to find markers predicting treatment response.
    Together, this work offers insight into immune cell roles in brain disorders.'
  techniques:
  - Our lab combines fluorescence imaging and proteomics methods with neurobiology,
    biochemistry, and data science to reach our goals.
  funding:
  - These projects are funded by the Michael J Fox Foundation, the Research Council
    of Finland, EU ERANET, Immudocs, and Inflames. We participate in international networks
    in the field of neuroscience, including informatics for neuroscience.
