  expertise:
  - My research focuses on harnessing the benign properties of bio-enabled plant biopolymers
    to design sustainable and functional biomaterials for better interfacing with
    living cells or microbes. To create effective bionanomaterials and soft matter
    biomaterials, my research applies core methodologies such as biopolymer chemical
    modifications, nanostructured biopolymer synthesis, and self-assembled biocolloidal
    networks from nano- to macro-scale.
