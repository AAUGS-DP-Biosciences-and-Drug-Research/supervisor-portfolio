  expertise:
  - Island biogeography
  - Long-term changes
  - Distribution patterns among plants and birds
  - Species-environment interactions
  projects:
  - My main research interests include long-term changes (among both plants and birds)
    and biogeographical questions concerning species distribution patterns in relation
    to the environment.
  techniques:
  - Fieldwork, GIS
  funding:
  - mainly domestic sources such as SKF
