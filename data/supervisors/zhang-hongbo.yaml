  expertise:
  - Nanomedicine
  - Biomedical Engineering
  - Drug Delivery
  - Gene Therapy
  projects:
  - Functional Materials have played a more and more critical role in developing
    novel treatment methods for different diseases. Our group focuses on designing all
    kinds of functional materials, at different scales, to solve clinical and biological
    problems.
  techniques:
  - We have broad collaborations with hospitals, and most of our projects have clinical
    doctors involved, and initially, from a real-life clinical question. Our group is
    multidisciplinary,  which involves an  interplay between physics, materials science, synthetic
    organic chemistry, engineering, biology, and medicine. We aim that many of our
    designs could be clinically applicable in the future, and have a tremendous social impact
    in treating diseases.
  funding:
  - 'I am coordinating many projects from the Research Council of Finland, Business Finland,
    and different foundations. I am also part of many consortium projects, including
    the InFlame flagship, NAP4DIVE (EU Horizon), Nordic POP, NordicPharmTrain, PII:
    Printed Intelligence Infrastructure, MADNESS (ÅAU Center of Excellence). As well
    as the collaboration project with companies, e.g., the joint project with Bayer
    Oy. I collaborate broadly with Harvard University, USA, and Chinese hospitals.'
