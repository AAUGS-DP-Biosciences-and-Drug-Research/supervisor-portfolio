# 🧬 Supervisor Portfolio for the Doctoral Programme in Biosciences and Drug Research

Welcome to the Supervisor Portfolio repository!

This project collects supervisor profiles using a Microsoft Form and automatically generates:
- 🌐 A public website showcasing each supervisor
- 📄 A downloadable master PDF portfolio

The website and PDF are continuously updated and hosted via **GitHub Pages**.
